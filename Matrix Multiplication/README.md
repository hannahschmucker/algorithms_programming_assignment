**Description - Compare the empiricial analysis of algoirthms by implementing, running, and analyzing the run-time data collected against theoretical predications for the purpose of Matrix Multiplication and Matrix-Chain Multiplication.**

- To execute: Be sure to run all cells, or if you go step-by-step, that all cells above have been executed. If not errors tend to pop up.

**zip files:** Algorithms.ipynb, README.md, and input.txt

- I've included descriptions above all blocks of code using Jupyter Notebook's markdown feature. Additionally, within the code blocks themselves, I've left some additional lines marked by comments including [test], which will not run but are there if clarity is needed. 

**environment** The author wrote the code in Jupyter Notebook, opened from the terminal and run on the default Python 3 (ipynb) kernal.

**additional sources** This was my first time coding in python; I had to reference two textbooks in order to get familiar with the NumPy and Pandas libraries, as well as the general syntax and operations of python. Additionally, I referenced W3Schools (website). 
(1) Introduction to Python Programming (https://openstax.org/details/books/introduction-python-programming) for assistance with list, lists of lists (pg 243), reading files (pg 347), NumPy and Pandas (pg 359).
(2) Python for Data Analysis, 3E (https://wesmckinney.com/book) for assistance with Arrays and Vectorized Computation, Plotting and Visualization, and Time Series.
       **All sources are credited below, are also marked within the code as follows: "## Source(#)"**
(3) Generative AI - Chat GPT as credited below. I prompted, "How can I remove the left-most default column from my data frame" and was given this code in response, "print(dataFrame.to_string(index=False))".
(4) W3 Schools for assistance with data frames (https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_dataframes.asp) and representing infinity (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-infinity/).

The author would like to acknowledge the use of Chat GPT, a language model developed by OpenAI, in the preparation of this assignment. The Chat GPT was used to aid in the removal of the default index column from all graphs, which occur in parts (3b-3), (3c-3), and step 3. 

I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I did not copy the whole or parts of it from another student or have another person write the code for me. Any code I am reusing or generated with Artificial Intelligence aid in my program is marked as such with its source identified in the comments.
